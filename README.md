# Learn Ruby

A sandbox for experimenting with [the Ruby programming language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/).


## Getting Started

1. Download and install dependencies:

   * [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/), a tool for managing development environments
   * [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), a tool for building and running virtual machines

2. Clone this repository, from the Git Shell on Windows or Terminal on Mac OS X:

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/Pitt-CSC/learn-ruby.git
   ```

3. Start the Vagrant machine:

   ```
   $ vagrant up
   ```

   The first time you start the VM, Ruby 2.1.3 will be installed on it. This will take a while -- be patient!


## Usage

To use the sandbox, make the sure the VM is running:

```
$ vagrant up
```

Open a shell in the VM:

```
$ vagrant up
```

In the VM, the `learn-ruby` repository is mounted at `/vagrant`. Change into the `/vagrant` directory:

```
$ cd /vagrant
```
